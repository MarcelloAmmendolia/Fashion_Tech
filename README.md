# Fashion_Tech
Fashion Tech is a repository about the wearable products I'm developing

The idea is to merge the fashion
This could be extremely interesting if we look at NFT's and the emerging need of possessing digital or virtual items.  
Based on a personal experience, NFT Art is still looking for the proper way to phisically "frame" unphisical objects.  
Example of this was the Milan Art Week in 2021, where everything was developed around showing NFT's, but, in the 
absolute majority of the cases, those were just projected on a wall or shown on a Screen.
In my mind, projectors should be used in immersive experiences with very special light conditions, far from the ones of those vernissages,  
and tv-like-screens where everybody is sitting in contemplating are something belonging to the past.
With NFT, art can store information and react to inputs. This should be also practically allowed in its fruition.

I've been thinking too much about you, I've been staring at the floor.
See the sunset with no sunset at all.
Constantly thinking about you...
